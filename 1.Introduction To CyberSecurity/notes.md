Cisco Networking Academy: Introduction to Cybersecurity

Course Overview
This beginner-level course introduces the fundamentals of cybersecurity, covering threats, defenses, ethical practices, and career opportunities.

Key Concepts

Cybersecurity Basics
Cybersecurity involves protecting computers, networks, programs, and data from unauthorized access, attacks, or damage. Core principles are captured in the CIA Triad: Confidentiality (authorized access only), Integrity (data accuracy), and Availability (accessible when needed).

Cyber Threats

Malware: Viruses, worms, and Trojans.

Phishing: Fraudulent emails or messages designed to steal information.

Ransomware: Malicious software that encrypts data until a ransom is paid.

Social Engineering: Manipulating individuals to gain access to sensitive information.

Cybersecurity Defenses

Firewalls and Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) help protect networks.

Encryption methods (symmetric and asymmetric) secure sensitive data.

Access control ensures proper authentication and authorization.

Safe online practices include strong passwords and awareness of phishing.

Laws, Ethics, and Careers

Ethical hacking involves testing systems for vulnerabilities within legal boundaries.

Understanding privacy regulations and data protection is essential.

Career opportunities include Security Analyst, Ethical Hacker, and Network Security Engineer.

Labs and Simulations

The course includes interactive, scenario-based exercises such as phishing detection, password strength testing, and proper handling of sensitive data. These reinforce learning without requiring deep technical setups.
