Cisco Networking Academy: Networking Basics

ðŸ“˜ **Course Overview**  
This beginner-level course introduces the fundamentals of networking, including devices, IP addressing, protocols, and basic network security. It provides a solid foundation for anyone starting in networking or cybersecurity.

ðŸ”¹ **Key Concepts**

**Network Fundamentals**  
- Networks connect devices to share information and resources.  
- Key devices: Routers, Switches, Hubs, Firewalls.  
- Common topologies: Star, Bus, Mesh â€” each with its advantages and limitations.  

**IP Addressing and Protocols**  
- IPv4 & IPv6: Unique addresses assigned to devices on a network.  
- Subnetting: Dividing networks into smaller segments for better organization.  
- Common protocols:  
  - TCP/IP: Ensures reliable data delivery.  
  - DNS: Resolves domain names to IP addresses.  
  - HTTP/HTTPS: Web communication protocols.  

**Networking Services and Operations**  
- DHCP: Automatically assigns IP addresses to devices.  
- NAT: Allows multiple devices to share a single public IP.  
- Routing: Directs data packets efficiently between networks.  

**Basic Network Security Principles**  
- Firewalls filter network traffic to enhance security.  
- Strong passwords and secure configurations prevent unauthorized access.  
- Awareness of threats such as malware and phishing is essential.  

ðŸ’» **Labs and Simulations**  
- Hands-on exercises include configuring IP addresses, exploring packet flow, and working with network devices.  
- Activities are guided and simulation-based, designed to reinforce practical understanding for beginners.
